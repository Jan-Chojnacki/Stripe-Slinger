# 🤠 Stripe Slinger

User‑space RAID simulation platform built on a microservices architecture. The core storage engine is implemented in Rust using FUSE, while the telemetry gateway is written in Go. The application allows for mounting virtual disk arrays, simulating drive failures, and visualizing real‑time I/O metrics through a Grafana and Alloy stack. Infrastructure and alerting rules are managed via Terraform, ensuring a consistent environment across Linux and macOS.
